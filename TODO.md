# TODO

- [ ] Progressively _enhance_ webapp with JavaScript.
  - The application works just fine with or without JavaScript. But we should enhance it so that when JS users alter the auth form inputs (after receiving an error message), the appropriate error message is dismissed. Consider `react-hook-form`.
- [ ] Add an example of how to get everything up an running with a PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] Cleanup code and make it less trash. (ongoing)
